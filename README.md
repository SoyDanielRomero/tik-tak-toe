# Tik-Tak-Toe 👨‍💻

This exercise is developed during the course at Mit xPro to get a certificate as a Profesional Full Stack Developer. This is about creating a simple tik-tak-toe game with react.

This App is developed with React and Babel to get more knowledge about CRUD, useState and other React properties.

## How to Run 🔧

To get started with this project, please:

1. Download or clone repo's files
2. Start a local server
3. Open index.html

### Roadmap of future improvements: 🗺

1. Responsive support
2. Brand styling
3. I would like to get players playing with a room score history. I plan to do this asking a name for each player, creating a room with a random name and store its score.
4. I would like to prevent players to set a button already played. Furthermore, I plan to do this with a ternary operator to set a button property to disabled if it has been filled.
5. Multiplayer Online Gaming
